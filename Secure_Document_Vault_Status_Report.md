## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Express.js with MongoDB as the database. The system uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

*[Insert architecture diagram showing the relationship between controllers, models, routes, and middleware]*

### 3.2 Database Schema

Three primary models form the core of the application:

**User Model:**

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  role: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Role',
    required: true
  }
});


**Role Model:**

const roleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    enum: ['user', 'admin', 'manager']
  },
  permissions: {
    type: [String],
    default: []
  }
});


**Document Model:**

const documentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fileName: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  fileType: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  tags: {
    type: [String],
    default: []
  },
  owner: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true
  },
  encryptedPath: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  accessControl: [{
    user: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User'
    },
    canView: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false
    },
    canEdit: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false
    }
  }]
});

### 3.3 Authentication System

The authentication system uses JWT tokens with role-based access control:

![Authentication Flow Diagram]
*[Insert diagram showing the authentication flow from login to protected routes]*

**Authentication Middleware:**

function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ 
      message: 'Authentication failed',
      code: 'AUTH_FAILED'
    });
  }
}


### 3.4 Document Encryption

Documents are secured using AES-256-CBC encryption with a unique initialization vector (IV) for each file:

![Encryption Process Diagram]
*[Insert diagram showing the encryption/decryption flow]*

**Encryption Implementation:**

async function encryptFile(filePath) {
  const encryptionKey = getEncryptionKey();
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(IV_LENGTH);
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(encryptionKey), iv);

  const input = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  const outputFilePath = filePath + '.enc';
  const output = fs.createWriteStream(outputFilePath);

  // Write the IV to the beginning of the file
  output.write(iv);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    input.pipe(cipher).pipe(output);
    output.on('finish', () => resolve(outputFilePath));
    output.on('error', reject);
  });
}

## 4. Challenges & Solutions

### 4.1 Encryption Key Management

**Challenge:** The system required a 32-character encryption key for AES-256, but the configuration was incorrect.

**Solution:** Implemented key validation and a generation utility:

### 4.2 File Upload Configuration

**Challenge:** Document uploads were failing due to configuration issues with multer and directory permissions.

**Solution:** Enhanced the upload configuration with better error handling and directory validation:

### 4.3 Role-Based Access

**Challenge:** User registration was failing due to role validation issues.

**Solution:** Implemented role seeding and improved validation:
